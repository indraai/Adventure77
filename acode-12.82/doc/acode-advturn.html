<h2 class=centered>A-code library mode interface</h2>

<p>Normally, A-code games drive their own main loop, but various app
frameworks insist on taking this functionality over. To cater for
implementations based on such frameworks, A-code kernel has a <i>library
mode</i>. When compiled in this mode, instead of having main(), it has a
function called advturn(), which takes as its sole character string argument a
a request (e.g. a player's command), and returns as its value a pointer to the
game's response.</p>

<p class=centered>char *advturn(char *command)<p>

<p>Examples of such builds are the emscripten-based HTML/JavaScript build
of Adv770 and Brian Ball's iOS build of the same game. The 
<a href='advbld.html'>advbld script</a> can be used to build test
library mode versions of game executables. It uses the <i>libtest.c</i>
wrapper provided with the kernel sources.</p>

<p>At present, there is on important restriction on A-code games to be built
using the library mode: they cannot use the QUERY directive. Reasons for this
restriction , as well as a workaround, can be found in <a
href="acode-context.html">a separate document describing the A-code CONTEXT
mechanism</a>.</p>

<p>The advturn function takes a character string as its single argument and
returns a pointer to a character string. This pointer is maintained by the
kernel and should not be manipulated by the calling code.</p>

<p>Once the game is running, the argument string contains a game command
obtained from the player and the returned pointer points to the game's
response to that command. However, there are also other special values that
the argument string can have:</p>

<dl>

<dt>&quot;_INFO_&quot;</dt>
<dd>Requests game's info. The returned string contains game's name, version and
date.</dd>

<dt><br>&quot;_LIST_&quot;</dt>
<dd>Requests the list of saved games separated with '|' (vertical bar) used as
a separator. If there is a game-in-progress save, it heads the list under the
name of the game prefixed with a dot (e.g. .adv770).
</dd>

<dt><br>&quot;_START_[{TEXT_|HTML_}]&quot;</dt>

<dd>Requests a new game to be started. The optional &quot;TEXT_&quot; or
&quot;HTML _&quot; force use of plain text or HTML output, as appropriate.
The default is HTML.</dd>

<dt><br>&quot;_RESUME_[{TEXT_|HTML_}]&quot;</dt>
<dd>Requests the game-in-progress (if any) to be resumed. Text or HTML output
can be nominated in the same manner as for _START_.</dd>

<dt><br>&quot;_LOAD_[{TEXT_|HTML_}]&lt;save_name&gt;&quot;</dt>

<dd>Requests the nominated saved game to be restarted. Here too,
&quotTEXT_&quot; or &quot;HTML_&quot; can be used to force the desired
output format, e.g. &quot;_LOAD_HTML_mygame&quot;.</dd>

</dl>

<p>Except for the above special cases, the argument string is interpreted as
the player's next command to be processed by the game. The output string
contains the full game's response, prefixed with a single character indicating
the type of the response:</p>

<ul>
<li>'f' means this is the final response &ndash; the game is over</li>
<li>'q' means the response is a query of some sort (not necessarily a yes/no
one)</li>
<li>'t' signals just ordinary text, which should be followed by a prompt
before requesting player's next command</li>
<li>'n' signals null response (this happens if the command string is null).
The rest of the response is unchanged from the previous non-null command.</li>
</ul

<p>The default game output format is HTML, except for console mode builds
where plain text is enforced. Paragraphs of plain text output are <b>not</b>
split into separate lines &ndash; any wrapping, if required, has to be done by
the calling code.</p>

<p>The simple <i>libtest.c</i> wrapper program supplied with the A-code kernel
sources provides an example of using the library mode.</p>

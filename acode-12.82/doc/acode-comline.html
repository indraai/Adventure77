<h2 class=centered>A-code game invocation options</h2>
<h4 class=centered>(A-code version 12.82)</h4>

<p>This document describes command line options available when running
an A-code game.  Game behaviour is generally regulated by the internally
documented acode.conf file, which can be found in the <b>.acode</b>
directory (just <b>acode</b> on MS platforms), automatically created in
player's home directory.  Where command line options refer to particular
features covered by the configuration file, they override the
configuration file settings.</p>

<p>Conventions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Angle brackets &lt;string&gt; denote a symbolic string to be
      replaced by something appropriate. E.g. &lt;filename&gt; would be
      replaced by the name of a file (with no surrounding angel brackets).
  </li>
  <li>Square brackets [ ] denote something optional. So e.g. 
      -l[&lt;logfilename&gt;] means that the name of the log file may
      be omitted.
  </li>
  <li>Braces { } denote a list of permissible values, separated
      by vertical bars |. E.g. -b[{0|1|2}] means the -b may be
      optionally (square brackets!) followed by one of the three digits
      zero,one or two.
  </li>
  <li>All options are shown with a short (single dash) prefix, but
      double dashes are also accepted.
  </li>
  <li>Where a value can be specified with a command line option,
      the syntax shown is that of the value abutting directly to
      the option specification letter. However, an equality sign =
      can be placed between the two, so that -b0 is equivalent to
      -b=0.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The following command line options are valid for both the browser
and the console display modes:</p>

<dl>
  <p><dt><b>-n</b></dt>
  <dd>Force a new game. By default, if a previous game session got
      somehow forcibly interrupted (e.g. by the game process being
      killed for whatever reason), the interrupted session is
      automatically resumed when the game is restarted. The -n
      option overrides this behaviour and forces the interrupted
      session to be forgotten.
  </dd>
  <p><dt><b>[-r]&lt;dumpfile&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Restore game from dump. Ignored if the game
      does not support game dump files being specified 
      on the command line.
      The -r optional in that any command line
      argument which does not begin with a dash
      will be interpreted as the name
      of the dumpfile to restore on invocation.
  </dd></p>
  <p><dt><b>-l[&lt;logfile&gt;]</b></dt>
  <dd>Log the game.
      Specifies the file into which a session log is to 
      be written. The log is human-readable, but has some
      additional information useful for debugging.
      If the nominated logfile
      already exists, it gets appended to. If no logfile is
      specified the name of the game is used, suffixed with .log.
  </dd></p>
  <p><dt><b>-B&lt;browser&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>
      Browser mode executables only.
      Use a non-default browser for player interaction.
      Browsers can be specified by their
      pathname, or by their name &ndash; in the latter case the name
      is searched for in directories given by the PATH variable.
  </dd></p>
  <p><dt><b>-C</b></dt>
  <dd>For browser-mode executables, force console display &ndash; 
      i.e. do not use the browser interface. For single turn mode executables
      this option enforces plain text, non-formatted output, instead of
      default HTML output.
  </dd></p>
  <p><dt><b>--</b></dt>
  <dd>For single turn executable, treat the rest of the command line
      as the player's game command.
  </dd></p>
  <p><dt><b>-b[{0|1|2}]</b></dt>
  <dd>Set or invert the blank line setting. If set to zero
      blank lines are inserted before and after each prompt.
      If the value is 1, blank lines around '?' prompts are suppressed,
      resulting in a more compact display. If the value is 2,
      then ALL blank lines are suppressed, for super-compact, but
      less readable output. If no value is specified, the
      new setting is 0 or 1, inverting the A-code default for this
      game. In old-style A-code (Adv550), which does 
      not distinguish between replies to queries and general
      commands, this only affects presence/absence of
      a blank line after the prompt line, and never before it.
  </dd></p>
  <p><dt><b>-u{0|1|none}</b></dt>
  <dd>Set the initial state of undo-history collection.
      Ignored if the game does not support undo.
      If the value is zero, the default undo status is OFF.
      If the value is one, the default undo status is ON.
      The "none" state implies OFF and disallows undo functionality
      being subsequently switched on from
      within the game. The default state is ON for games
      which define the verb UNDO, and "none" otherwise.
  </dd></p>
  <p><dt><b>-v</b></dt>
  <dd>Show the game, kernel and acdc version numbers and exit.
  </dd></p>
  <p><dt><b>-h</b></dt>
  <dd>Print command line usage summary appropriate to the mode of
      the executable's build.
  </dd></p>

  <p>In addition, some options are only meaningful in the console
  display mode, and are simply ignored in other modes.</p>

  <p><dt><b>-j[{0|1}]</b></dt>
  <dd>Set text mode to wrap (0) or justify (1). If no value is
      specified, invert the default A-code setting for this game.
      In wrap mode, text is simply broken into lines according
      to the screen width (see the -s option below). With
      justification turned on, each line is right-justified.
      All of this presupposes a fixed font being in use. For
      variable font devices, which tend to do their own
      wrapping, the default screen width should be set to zero,
      meaning "infinite", and the margin should be specified as
      zero too. This option is ignored by games written in the 
      "old style" A-code (i.e. by adv550).
  </dd></p>
  <p><dt><b>-s&lt;W&gt;.&lt;H&gt;[.&lt;M&gt;]</b></dt>
  <dd>Set screen size (width in fixed font characters, height
      in lines, and margin in fixed font blanks).
      The default screen dimension is 80x24-1, the margin
      being set to 1 character. The -s option allows a
      different screen size (and optionally margin) to be 
      specified. Screen width of zero means "infinite" width.
      Note that the line length cannot be set to less than
      16 characters and the minimal number of lines per
      screen is 5.
  </dd></p>
  <p><dt><b>-o&lt;baudrate&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Set the output speed as specified by the <baudrate>
      argument. Meaningful only in the "dumb" console mode and
      only if C sources compiled without the NO_SLOW symbol.
      Baud rate is specified in bits per second, and taking
      into the account control and parity bits, the output
      speed in characters per second is simply the baud rate
      divided by 10. The game coerces the specified baud
      rate to the nearest lower standard value (one of
      110, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800 and 9600), except
      that anything below 110 (the speed of a teletype) is
      also treated as 110. The default value is 300 - the
      speed of a DECwriter. Note, however, that under DOS
      and Windows any baud rate above 600 results in no
      slowdown at all.
  </dd></p>
  <p><dt><b>-p[{0|1}]</b></dt>
  <dd>Pause on exit.
      Requests that after printing the final exit message
      the game should prompt the player for a &lt;CR&gt;, before exiting.
      This feature is intended for players who wish to
      play console version of the game, in a window which
      closes as soon as the game exits.
  </dd></p>
</dl>

<p>The functionality of the <b>-s</b>, <b>-u</b> and
<b>-j</b> options is also provided via kernel hooks (see
procedure special() in the kernel source file adv00.c), so that the game
may -- at author's discretion -- offer the player commands for toggling
the justification switch, switching on and off the change history, and
altering screen size and margin.  </p>

<p>Finally, if the game was build to have a separate data file
(only useful for DOS builds, nowadays),
a non-default location of that file may be specified via the -d
option.</p>

<dl>
  <p><dt><b>-d&lt;dbsdir&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>If using a data file, specify its directory.
      Ignored if the game is built as a simple executable
      with no associated data file.
      By default, the game data file is assumed to live in
      the same directory as the executable. The -d option
      allows a separate location to be specified. The
      program will attempt to work out the separator
      which should follow the directory name, but if in doubt
      as to the appropriate one for the given platform,
      the dbs name will be simply concatenated with the
      supplied pathname -- hence if it doesn't work, try
      adding the trailing separator to the pathname.
  </dd></p>
</dl>

<p>Any unknown or suppressed keywords are quietly ignored.</p>

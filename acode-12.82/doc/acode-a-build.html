<h3>A-code source</h3>

<p>Logically, an A-code source is a single file, usually with the .acd
suffix. The suffix is optional; if present, it can be omitted when
nominating to <b>acdc</b> the A-code file to be processed.</p>

<p>In practice, A-code source can be split into a number of files, which
are incorporated in the &quot;main&quot; one by means of the A-code
<i>include</i> major directive. Again, such include files are
conventionally suffixed with .acd, which suffix may be omitted in
<i>include</i> statements.</p>

<hr id=frame>

<h3>A-code framework</h3>

<p>To build a working executable out of A-code source, you need A-code kernel
files, available as a part of the acode system source tarball
<a href='https://mipmip.org/acode/acode-12.82.tgz'>
https://mipmip.org/acode/acode-12.82.html</a>. This tarball contains C
sources of the latest releases of the <b>acdc</b> translator and of the A-code
kernel, as well as some useful bash scripts. See that page for details.</p>

<p>If you are using Linux, Unix or OSX, the simplest thing to do is to use the
<a href="advbld.html"><b>advbld</b> script</a> supplied as a part of the
acode source tarball &ndash; please see the README file contained therein.
However, if you are using some other platform, you will probably need to build
and use <b>acdc</b> yourself. The rest of this document explains how to do
that.</p>

<hr id=acdc>

<h3>Building and using the <b>acdc</b> translator</h3>

<p>To build the <b>acdc</b> executable you need only an ANSI C compiler.
Simply compile and link the relevant C sources &ndash; no libraries or
special compilation or linking options required.<p>

<p>The <b>acdc</b> translator takes the following command
line arguments (in any order):</p>

<dl>

  <p><dt><b>&lt;sourcefile&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>The name or pathname of the main A-code source file; 
    if omitted, it is prompted for. Any include
    statements are taken to be relative to the directory in which the main
    source file is located. 
  </dd></p>

  <p><dt><b>-plain</b> abbreviable to <b>-p</b></dt>
  <dd>Causes the game text data not to be encrypted.
  </dd></p>

  <p><dt><b>-xref</b> abbreviable to <b>-x</b></dt>

  <dd>Requests that a cross-reference file of the A-code source be
      created.  For technical reasons (meaning I am being lazy), this file is
      called <b>game.xrf</b>. It is not sorted and can be processed further
      with the <b>sortref</b> Perl utility, supplied as a part of
      the acode package. 
  </dd></p>

  <p><dt><b>-no-warnings</b> abbreviable to <b>-nw</b></dt>
  <dd>Suppresses warnings about unused symbols in the A-code source.
  </dd></p>

  <p><dt><b>-quiet</b> abbreviable to <b>-q</b></dt>
  <dd>Suppresses most of the standard info messages generated by
      acdc in translating the A-code source.
  </dd></p>

  <p><dt><b>-debug</b> abbreviable to <b>-d</b></dt>
  <dd>Causes A-code source to be added as comment lines to the translated
      C source files. Also adds trace message showing individual
      A-code code chunks being entered during play. Also causes the 
      DEBUG symbol to be defined in the kernel source.
  </dd></p>

  <p><dt><b>-help</b> abbreviable to <b>-h</b></dt>
  <dd>Lists available command line arguments.
  </dd></p>

</dl>

<p>By default, the game's text data is preloaded into the executable. These
days only very old and/or small machines are unhappy with the size of the
resulting executable. However, if the default behaviour is for any reason
not the suitable one, there are three furtherm deprecated command line options
that can be used.</p>

<dl>

  <p><dt><b>-file-memory</b> abbreviable to <b>-fm</b></dt>
  <dd>Requests a separate .dat text data file to be created
      and to be read in full into the game'ss memory on startup.
      Useful only if the OS objects to large executables.
  </dd></p>

  <p><dt><b>-file-read</b> abbreviable to <b>-fr</b></dt>
  <dd>Requests a separate .dat text data file to be created
      and to be accessed by the game by direct file reads as required.
      Only useful for <i>really</i> small, slow machines.
  </dd></p>

  <p><dt><b>-file-page [&lt;npage&gt;]</b> abbreviable to <b>-fp</b></dt>
  <dd>Requests a separate .dat text data file to be created
      and to be accessed by the game
      using its own internal paging mechanism. The optional
      &lt;npage&gt; argument defaults to 32 and specifies the number
      of 1KB paging buffers. Only useful for <i>really</i> small, 
      slow machines.
  </dd></p>

</dl>

<p>Derived ANSI C sources are created in the directory from which <b>acdc</b>
is run, except that if a sub-directory called C is found in the directory in
which the A-code source is located, the derived sources are placed there. </p>

<hr id=kernel>

<h3>Adding kernel source files</h3>

<p>The A-code kernel consists of source files <b>adv00.c</b>,
<b>adv01.h</b> and <b>adv0.h</b>.  All three can be found in the 
A-code source tarball.  Copy them alongside the C sources created by
<b>acdc</b>, and you will have the complete C source required
to build an executable.</p>

<hr id=executable>

<h3>Building an executable</h3>

<p>Building a simple adventure executable from the derived C sources is
simplicity itself: just compile and link the lot together with any ANSI
C compiler. The resulting executable will default to using a local
browser for its display (except for DOS builds). But it will lack
command history and editing in the console mode.
If that's good enough for you, fine, but if you hit problems, or want a
more sophisticated version, read the guide to <a href="acode-c-build.html">
building A-code games from intermediate C sources</a>.</p>

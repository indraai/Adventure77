<h2 class=centered>A-code build types</h2>

<p>
  A-code games can be built in a number of different ways, such as e.g.
  console only. This document explains all these build types and their uses.
  For details on actually building games in verious modes, please see <a
  href="acode-c-build.html">a separate page</a> explaining how to build A-code
  games from derived ANSI C sources.

<h3 id=console class=centered>The <i>console</i> build</h3>

<p>
  The console build replicates how the original Adventure was initially
  played. It takes input directly from the player and outputs any responses in
  plain text to a "computer terminal" &ndash; these days most likely a
  terminal emulator window. Some players still prefer this build typeand it is
  also very handy for debugging.
</p>

<p>
  While it still defaults to the dimensions of displays of ancient VDUs (24
  lines and 80 fixed font characters per line), other dimensions can be
  specified on the invocation command line by means of the -s option. The
  kernel also provides the necessary hooks for a game to permit changes to
  these defaults while playing.
</p>

<p>
  The console build also offers a unique opportunity to experience an A-code
  game the way the original Adventure was played in 1970s/80s. The -o command
  line option allows the output speed to be set to the baud rate of 110 (a
  teletype), 300 (earliest VDUs), 600, 1200, 2400, 4800 and 9600. Younger
  players are hereby invited to marvel at the patience required to play at the
  lower speeds (as we did!).
</p>

<p>
  For the full list of console build command line options, please see the
  document describing <a href="acode-comline.html">command line invocation</a>
  of A-code games.
</p>

<hr class=dash>

<h3 id=browser class=centered>The <i>browser/console</i> build</h3>

<p>
  By default, A-code games built in this way do not interact with the player
  directly, but instead invoke a local browser and use that to render game's
  output and to obtain player's commands. In this mode, an A-code game acts as
  a very simple HTTP server. No access to network is involved &ndash; there's
  just local socket-based communication between the game and the browser.
</p>

<p>
  Unless otherwise specified, the player's default browser is invoked, but
  another browser can be specified either on the invocation command line or by
  modifying the acode.config file created by the A-code kernel.
</p>

<p>
  The browser build of an A-code game automatically includes the console build
  (but not the other way around!). Thus a browser-build game can be invoked in
  the console mode by adding -C to the invocation command line. All console
  build command line options apply when -C is spcified.
</p>

<hr class=dash>

<h3 id=library class=centered>The <i>library</i> build</h3>

<p>
  In some cases it is not feasible or appropriate for an A-code game to drive
  its own command/response loop. App frameworks generally expect to do so
  themselves. This situation is handled by compiling derived C sources in the
  library mode &ndash; used, for example, in Brian Ball's iOS port of Adv770
  and in HTML/JavaScript builds of A-code games.
</p>

<p>
  A simple such wrapper (<i>libtest.c</i>) is provided with kernel sources and
  should be compiled and linked with derived C-sources and with kernel sources
  to produce a library build executable.
</p>

<hr class=dash>

<h3 id=javascript class=centered>The <i>HTML/JavaScript</i> build</h3>

<p>
  Thanks to the magic of <a
  href="http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/">emscripten</a>, A-code
  games can be built as pure (and purely local, with no network dependencies)
  HTML/JavaScript page, usable by any HTML5 compliant browser. If built this
  way, A-code games run entirely within the player's browser with no access to
  the network, and use browser's own sand-boxed file system for saving and
  restoring games.
</p>

<hr class=dash>

<h3 id=qt5 class=centered>The <i>QT5</i> build</h3>

<p>The QT5 build uses the library mode of A-code and wraps it in a QT5
GUI front-end.

<hr class=dash>

<h3 id=single class=centered>The <i>single turn</i> build</h3>

<p>
  Originally developed for CGI operation, single turn game builds are only
  suitable for running in a cloud, via a suitable front-end script, e.g. a
  cgi-bin or a PHP one. In this mode, the game executable is supplied a single
  command as a parameter on the invocation command line, sends the text
  generated in response to standard output and exits. (See the <a
  href="acode-comline.html"> the command line options document</a> for
  details.)
</p>

<p>
  The actual interaction with the player is carried out by the front-end
  script, which repeatedly invokes the executable for successive game turns.
  The secret sauce is, of course, the player-invisible save and restore of the
  current state of the game. This mechanism got later adapted for use by other
  game modes, automatically giving all A-code games a persistent state.
</p>

<p>
  In this build all text output is HTML-formatted by default, though this can
  be overridden if necessary, by adding -C to the invocation command line. All
  output text is also prefixed by a single character, which provides
  information to the wrapper script and is not expected to be displayed to the
  player.

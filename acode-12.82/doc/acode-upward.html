<h2 class=centered>A-code upward compatibility of saved games</h2>

<p>A-code makes it fairly simple to preserve upward compatibility of saved
games. Essentially, all one has to do is to ensure that refnos of game's
entities do not change relative to a given entity type. Clearly, this
terse summary needs unpacking...<p>

<p>Refnos were briefly explained <a href="acode-language.html#refnos">in the
main description of the A-code language</a>, so just briefly...</p>

<p>A refno (or in full a reference number) is a number uniquely assigned by
A-code to value-bearing declared entities &ndash; i.e. to objects, locations,
variables and texts. The important point is that these refnos are allocated
sequentially within each of these four categories in the order of entity
declarations. Thus in a game source which mixes randomly object, place,
variable and text declarations, objects will be numbered consecutively in
their order of declaration, followed by places in their order of declaration
etc.</p> 

<p>It is by preserving associations of refnos to game entities <i>within</i>
these categories that saved games are kept upwardly compatible. So let's
consider what specifically would or would not break such compatibility. For
simplicity, I'll stick with talking about objects, but exactly the same points
apply within the other categories.</p>

<p>If a previously declared object is removed in a later version of game's
code, then all objects declared after the removed one will have their refnos
reduced by one. If there are such objects, compatibility breaks. If there
aren't (i.e. if the last declared object was removed, it does not break.</p>

<p>Similarly, if an object is added, then refnos of all objects declared later
in the game's code will be increased by one. If there are such objects,
compatibility breaks. If there aren't (i.e. if the added object is the last
object declaration, it does not break.</p>

<p>So, <b>Rule 1: do not add or remove objects except at the end of all
object declarations.</b></p>

<p>Remember that A-code allows forward declarations. I.e. you can reference an
object <i>before</i> it is declared. Hence adding new objects only at the end
is not a problem. But what if you need to remove an object which is not the
last in object declaration order? Simple: don't remove it. Just leave it
there, possibly giving it a different name, e.g. SPARE.OBJ.1 or something
equally obvious. Better still, make its new name start with a dot:
.SPARE.OBJ.1 -- this will stop the <i>acdc</i> translator complaining about an
object being declared but not used. If later on you do want to re-use that
spare slot for some other object, you can do so, but you cannot assume its
value to be zero after a game is reloaded &ndash; that game may have been
saved before you removed the original object.<p>

<p>In fact, the same applies to removing and then adding an object at the end
of object declarations, so here's a safer version of the rule:</p>

<p><b>Rule 1a: do not remove objects; any additional objects must be added
at the end of all object declarations.</b></p>

<p>As explained in <a href="acode-language.html#flags">the language description
document</a>, in addition to an integer value all objects, places and
variables carry a bit-screen of flags. Flags have to be declared as symbolic
names, but as far as the A-code kernel is concerned, such names are just
synonyms for integer (non-negative) bit-screen offsets. Just as for refno
association with entities, the association of these values with flag symbolic
names must be preserved if saved games are upwardly compatible.</p>

<p>Therefore Rule 1, stated above, applies to flag declarations too
(separately for object, location and variable flag sets), but there is an
additional constraint, which can be stated as</p>

<p><b>Rule 2: do not change bit-screen byte-sizes!</b></p>

<p>Again, this needs unpacking and to do so, I need to explain a bit about
internal data structures involved.</p>

<p>While A-code only permits a single flags declaration for both of objects
and places, multiple flag sets of various sizes can be declared for variables.
It may seem puzzling that bit-screens carried by variables are not somehow
associated with particular variables (except possibly via code comments). The
simple explanation is that there is in fact just one bit-screen for variables
too. All the separate declarations of it merely define different synonyms for
the same bit offsets. Thus e.g.</p>

<pre>
FLAGS VARIABLE
      FLAG1
      FLAG2
FLAGS VARIABLE
      FLAG3
      FLAG4
      FLAG5
</pre>

<p>define one bit-screen of three bits, where FLAG1 and FLAG3 are both synonyms
for 0, FLAG2 and FLAG4 are both synonyms for 1, and FLAG5 is a synonym for 2.</p>

<p>To make things more complicated, for historical reasons, location and
object bit-screens automatically reserve the first three bits for kernel's
use. Thus</p>

<pre>
FLAGS OBJECT
      OFLAG1
      OFLAG2
</pre>

<p>declares a bit-screen of <b>five</b> bits, with OFLAG1 as a symbolic name for 3
and OFLAG2 as a symbolic name for 4.</p>

<p>And as a final complication, bit-screens are actually allocated in 8-bit
bytes. Hence in the above examples, the object bit-screen will have three spare
flags (offsets 5, 6 and 7), while the variable bit-screen will have 5 spare
(offsets 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7).</p>

<p>We are now ready to calculate &quot;bit-screen byte-sizes&quot; that have to be
preserved. If the longest variable bit-screen declared by game's code has N
flags, the size of the bit-screen is the smallest number of 8-bit bytes
containing at least N bits. For both place and object bit-screens it is the
smallest number of bytes containing at least N + 3 bits.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, if you have 17 distinct (non-synonymous) object flags,
the number of bits actually uses is 20, leaving you with four spare flags. Of
course, there is nothing to stop you declaring explicitly some spare flags
(with names prefixed with a . to keep <i>acdc</i> happy) for potential future
use.</p?

<p>That's almost it, but there is an additional wrinkle to do with texts.</p>

<p><b>Rule 3: do not use text morphing features in in-line texts.</b></p>

<p>By this I mean texts which have an internal dynamic: incrementing, cycling
or randomised &ndash; in the case of in-line texts signalled respectively by
'i:', 'c:' and 'r:' at the beginning of the text. The 'f:' prefix, signalling
that the in-line text is a fragment, is benign.</p>

<p>The reason for this restriction is simple: by their very nature, the order
of declaration of inline texts is what it is. While the <i>acdc</i> translator
can group them all safely at the end of text refnos, it can do nothing about
their ordering. Therefore adding an in-line text necessarily increments refnos
of all succeeding in-line texts. If such texts have no internal dynamic, this
is not a problem, since being nameless, they cannot be referenced from
elsewhere in the code.</p>

<p>And that's really it. Just remember that Rule 1 applies separately to
locations, declared texts and flags as well. In practice, while working on and
testing Adv770 I found that preserving upward compatibility between game
versions was not hard. If the kernel ever changes in a way which would enforce
upward compatibility break, this will be signalled by a change in its major
version number. </p>

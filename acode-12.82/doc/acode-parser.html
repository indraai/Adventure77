<h3>Where and when parsing takes place</h3>

There is no separate A-code directive for player command parsing. Parsing
takes place as an integral part of acquiring player input. There are two
separate minor directives which do so: INPUT and QUERY. It is INPUT that does
the heavy lifting. The much simpler QUERY directive is there merely as a
convenience for asking yes/no questions. For reasons <a
href="acode-context.html">explained elsewhere</a> it has to be avoided in
A-code games, which are expected to be built in single-turn or library modes.

<div class=indented>
<hr class=dotted id=query>
<h4>The QUERY directive</h4>

<p>The QUERY directive is in fact one of the set of A-code conditionals. It
takes as its single argument a text, which gets displayed as a prompt and
expects yes or no in response. For example:</p>

<div class=indented><pre>
QUERY "Do you really mean it?"
   SAY "It shall be done, boss!"    # Player said yes
ELSE
   SAY "Oh, OK. You had me worried there for a moment."   # Player said no
FIN
</pre></div>

<p>Parsing is extremely primitive: any response starting with 'n' (or 'N') is
taken to mean &quot;no&quot;, and any response starting with 'y' (or 'Y') is
taken to mean &quot;yes&quot;. A null response is interpreted as
&quot;yes&quot;. Any other response is rejected with &quot;<i>Eh? Do me a
favour and answer yes or no! Which will it be?</i>&quot; (this text is at
present hard-wired into the kernel). If the player still responds with
something that cannot be interpreted as yes or no, the parser says
&quot;<i>(OK, smartass... I'll assume you mean YES - so there!)</i>&quot;
(also hard-wired) and returns true.</p>

<hr class=dotted id=input>
<h4>The INPUT directive</h4>

<p>The INPUT directive is the one that acquires and parses player commands. It
takes as its optional argument a text (or a variable pointing to a text),
which is to be used as a prompt, instead of the default question mark followed
by a space. The rest of this document is devoted to parsing done by INPUT.</p>

<p>While the basic form of a player command has the simple &quot;&lt;verb&gt;
&lt;noun&gt;" format, the parser can handle <a href="#compound">compound
commands</a>, reducible to a series of simple command in the basic format.
When a compound command is given, successive executions of the INPUT directive
process the implied simple commands, one at a time.</p>

<p>The result of parsing a simple command is delivered in three variables:
ARG1, ARG2 and STATUS. ARG1 and ARG2 contain respectively refnos of the verb
and the noun of the simple command parsed. The STATUS variable is set to the
number of words in the command: one or two. For more detail see below, in the
section on <a href=#matching>identifying vocabulary words</a>.

</div><hr id=core>
<h3>Core parser operation</h3>

<div class=indented>

<p>Conceptually, A-code command parsing has three separate components:</p>

<ul>
<li>Parsing that is performed by the INPUT directive regardless of the
game code,</li>
<li>Additional parsing features which are enabled by some particular
entities being declared in the game code, and</li>
<li>Optional parsing features made available by the kernel to A-code games.</li>
</ul>

<p>This section deals with core parsing features, which are not influenced
by the game code.</p>

<hr class=dotted id=simple>
<h4>Simple commands</h4>

<p>A command consists of one or more words (a.k.a. tokens), delimited by
blanks (spaces) and/or commas (,) and/or dots (.) and/or semicolons (;). All
leading and trailing blanks are ignored and multiple blanks are treated as a
single blank.</p>

<p>A simple player command has the verb or verb/noun structure. E.g.</p>

<div class=indented>
<pre>
GET LAMP
</pre>
</div>

<hr class=dotted id=compound>
<h4>Compound commands</h4>

<p>Compound commands can be constructed by joining simple commands by command
delimiters. The parser recognises three such delimits, which are
completely synonymous: a semicolon (;), a dot (.) or '&nbsp;then&nbsp;' (note
that unlike the colon or the dot, the '&nbsp;then&nbsp;' delimiter must be
surrounded by blanks, to make it into a separate token.</p>

<p>Compound command may also feature object iteration: a verb followed by a
list of nouns, separated by commas (,) or '&nbsp;and&nbsp;'. Again, the 
surrounding blanks are mandatory for the latter form.</p>

<p>Thus for example,</p>

<div class=indented>
<pre>
GET LAMP AND KEYS THEN READ POSTER
</pre>
</div>

is equivalent to

<div class=indented>
<pre>
GET LAMP, KEYS. READ POSTER
</pre>
</div>

<p>and is parsed as meaning</p>

<div class=indented>
<pre>
GET LAMP
GET KEYS
READ POSTER
</pre>
</div>

<p>In order to be maximally forgiving, the parser will also understand 
some incorrect but unambiguous variants on this syntax. E.g. in
'&nbsp;and&nbsp;then&nbsp;' (equivalent to ',.') the iteration delimiter
is ignored. So</p>

<div class=indented>
<pre>
GET LAMP AND KEYS AND THEN READ POSTER
</pre>
</div>

<p>will have the obviously intended effect.</p>

<hr class=dotted id=matching>
<h4>Identifying command words</h4>

<p>Individual command tokens are matched against the game's vocabulary.
At game's discretion, the matching process may be</p>

<ul>
<li>restricted to exact matches, or</li>
<li>permit minimal (automatically derived) abbreviations, or</li>
<li>permit single
typo correction &ndash; see the <a href='acode-vocabulary.html'>vocabulary
description</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href='acode-vocabulary.html'>A-code vocabulary description</a>
for details of command words matching against game's vocabulary.</p>

<p>If a simple command is parsed successfully, values of ARG1 and ARG2 are set
to the refno values corresponding to the first and the second command token
respectively. However, a further enhancement, if ARG1 value turns out to be in
the range of object or location refnos, and ARG2 in the range of verb refnos,
the two command words are swapped around. Thus, for example BIRD GET gets
parsed as GET BIRD.</p>

<p>An additional parsing feature is present for games of style 11 or higher.
If no match is found for the second command word, the kernel still does not
give up. It is possible that the player was trying to reference something
mentioned in an object or place description, or in some response recently
given to an earlier command. Every time some text is output, all of its words
longer than 3 characters and not ending in "ing", are stored in a separate,
temporary vocabulary. This vocabulary, which is re-initialised whenever the
player changes location, is scanned for an exact match (no abbreviations or
typos). If a match is found, this is still treated as a matching failure, but
of a different kind, so that if desired, it can be treated differently by
A-code source.</p>

<p>If the parser fails to match a vocabulary word, the corresponding ARG1 or
ARG2 variable is set to one of special pre-defined values:</p>

<ul>
<li>BADWORD &ndash; no match of any kind.</li>
<li>AMBIGWORD &ndash; abbreviation matching gives a non-unique result &ndash;
more than one vocabulary word could be meant.</li>
<li>AMBIGTYPO &ndash; single typo matching gives a non-unique result.</li>
<li>SCENEWORD &ndash; the match is not against the vocabulary by against
the list of words used by the guide since the last change of location.</li>
<li>BADSYNTAX &ndash; any other parsing failure.</li>
</ul>

<hr class=dotted id=blanks>
<h4>Treating blanks as list or command separators</h4>

<p>The verb SAY is treated by the parser as a special case in that spaces can
be used instead of commas as in SAY FEE FIE FOE, which is treated as
SAY FEE, FIE, FOE (which is equivalent to SAY FEE; SAY FIE; SAY FOE).</p>

<hr class=dotted id=invert>
<h4>Inverting verb/noun order</h4>

<p>By default, in two word commands, the first command token is considered to
be the verb and the second one as the noun, e.g. TAKE BOTTLE. However, if the
first token is not likely to be a verb (being e.g. a place or an object) and
the the second is identifiably a verb, the parser will automatically swap them
around, making BOTTLE TAKE also a legitimate command.</p>

</div><hr id=additional>
<h3>Additional parsing features enabled by game code</h3>

<p>Some functionality of the A-code kernel is only present if game source
defines particular entites.</p>

<div class=indented>
<hr class=dotted id=again>
<h4>Repeating commands</h4>

<p>If game source declares the word AGAIN (possibly with some synonyms),
commands can be repeated by using AGAIN as a verb. If used within a compound
command it will repeat the last sub-command delimited by THEN (or a dot or a
semicolon). If used on its own, it will repeat the whole of the player's last
input, which may be a compound command (and may itself contain AGAIN on order
to repeat its sub-command).</p>

<p>So, for example:</p>

<div class=indented>
<pre>
GET BUCKET.DRINK BUCKET. AGAIN
</pre>
</div>

<p>is equivalent to</p> 

<div class=indented>
<pre>
GET BUCKET
DRINK BUCKET
DRINK BUCKET
</pre>
</div>

<p>whereas</p>

<div class=indented>
<pre>
THROW AXE THEN GET AXE
AGAIN
</pre>
</div>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<div class=indented>
<pre>
THROW AXE THEN GET AXE
THROW AXE THEN GET AXE
</pre>
</div>

<hr class=dotted id=special>
<h4>Non-vocabulary &quot;nouns&quot;</h4>

<p>Sometimes it is not desirable to match player input against the games
vocabulary at all. Saving and restoring games is an obvious example of this
&ndash; players cannot be restricted to game's vocabulary for naming saved
games. One could, of course, insist that SAVE and RESTORE do not take a save
name as the second word of the command, but invoke instead a separate input
routine, which takes the desired save name without any reference to the
vocabulary. However, the same applies to any command which takes a numerical
argument, e.g. specifying screen width or height in the console mode.<p>

<p>Rather than having special code for handling such (and similar) exceptions,
A-code's approach is to tag relevant verbs as &quot;special&quot;. In the
absence of flag settings for vocabulary words (possibly to be rectified in the
future), the solution is to groups declaration of such verbs between
declarations of two pseudo-verbs: first.special and last.special. This works
because (a) A-code allocates refnos (in a given entity category) in the order
of declarations and (b) if prefixed with '-' these pseudo-verbs are
themselves allocated refno, but are not added to the game's vocabulary. Here's
an example based on Adv770:</p>

<div class=indented><pre>
# The next block are specials, not requiring validation of ARG2.
#
verb -first.special        # Mark the first one
verb again, repeat, =r
verb save, suspend, pause
verb restore, load
verb rest, wait            # In case players type REST MYGAME
verb !length, =!line, =!width
verb !scroll, =!screen, =!depth
verb !margin, =!offset
verb restart, initialise
verb why
verb please
verb -last.special         # Mark end of special verbs
#
# End of verbs not requiring validation of ARG2.
</pre></div>

<p>The kernel is aware of the special significance of first.special and
last.special and will automatically suppress validation of the second
command word when parsing a command with any verbs defined as special in this
manner. However,  a similar mechanism can be profitably used by A-code source.
Here's another example from Adv770:</p>

<div class=indented><pre>
verb -first.direction
verb north, =n
verb northeast, =ne
verb east, =e
verb southeast, =se
verb south, =s
verb southwest, =sw
verb west, =w
verb northwest, =nw
verb -last.compass.point
verb up, =u, upward, ascend
verb down, =d, downwards, descend
verb -last.direction
</pre></div>

<p>This makes it easy to check for a command word being a direction</p>

<div class=indented><pre>
IFINRANGE ARG2, FIRST.DIRECTION, LAST.DIRECTION
</pre></div>

<p>or a compass point:</p>

<div class=indented><pre>
IFINRANGE ARG2, FIRST.DIRECTION, LAST.COMPASS.POINT
</pre></div>

<hr class=dotted id=it>
<h4>Handling IT</h4>

<p>Handling the indexical noun IT is fairly straightforward in A-code. One
declares a dummy object of that name (with whatever synonyms may be deemed
appropriate) and sets its value to be a pointer to an appropriate object.
The value of IT should be set to a pointer to an object in the following
situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>A player command explicitly names an object.</li>
<li>Player's inventory gets listed and the list consists of a single
object.</li> 
<li>Objects in the current location get listed and the list consists of a
single object.</li>
</ul>

<p>OTOH the value of IT should be probably cleared (set to zero) if either of
the two kind of object list contain more than one item.</p>

<p>If a player's command contains the word IT and the IT object has a non-zero
value FAKECOM can be used to set ARG! or ARG2 (as appropriate) to pretend that
the command explicitly named the object pointed at by IT.</p>

<p>None of the above involves any special kernel functionality, so why is the
matter even mentioned in this description of command parsing by the kernel?
The reason is that there is one other situation which requires the value of IT
to be modified, and that situation is handled by the kernel.</p>

<p>If IT is declared as an object and the game source successfully uses the
DEFAULT directive to select a default object, then IT is automatically set
by the kernel to point at the object defaulted to.</p>

</div>


</div><hr id=codeenabled>
<h3>Optional parsing features available to game code</h3>

<p>Other features of the A-code kernel, which are also dependent on some
entities being or not being defined in game source, do not take effect
automatically, but have to be explicitly triggered by game code as and
when appropriate.</p>

<div class=indented>
<hr class=dotted id=orphans>
<h4>Orphan processing</h4>

<p>If a player issues a single word command, which can be assumed to imply a
a target object on an action (e.g. PUSH on its own, or KEYS ditto), the game
can do better than just complain that not enough information has been given.
If the A-code source declares PLS.CLARIFY as a flag, setting this flag on the
automatic variable STATUS affect the way the next command gets parsed.</p>

<p>If the next command also consists of a single word, the &quot;orphan
processing&quot; mechanism comes into play. It combines this command with the
preceding one-word one, so that the player does not have to repeat the
previously typed word. On the other hand, if the next command consists of two
words, it is parsed in the usual manner and the clarification request is
ignored. The PLS.CLARIFY flag gets automatically unset in either case, so
that it does not have to unset explicitly by the game's code.</p>

<p> Here's an example of orphan processing in action:</p>

<div class=indented><pre>
? get
What do you want me to get?
? rod
You get the rod.
? rod
What do you want me to do with the rod?
? drop
You drop the rod.
?</pre></div>

<p>The underlying code dealing with generic GET requests could look like
this:</p>

<div class=indented><pre>
action get
   ifeq status, 1
      default portable            # Find default object flagged as portable
      ifeq arg2, ambigword        # If more than one possible target
         flag status, pls.clarify # Activate orphan processing
         quip "What do you want me to {arg1}?"
      fin
......
</pre></div>

<p>The code for handling the drop command in the above example would have to
come into play, once the game fails to find an action associated with the word
ROD.</p>

<div class=indented><pre>
   call arg1                   # If arg1 has an essociated action, execute it
   ifflag arg1, object         # We fell through, so presumably no such action
      flag status, pls.clarify # Activate orphan processing
      quip "What do you want me to do with the {arg1}?"
   fin
</pre></div>

<hr class=dotted id=all>
<h4>Handling collective nouns</h4>

<p>The A-code language makes it easy for a game to permit use of collective
nouns such as, for example, ALL or TREASURE. This is done by using the A-code
directive DOALL before handling the verb to be applied to a collective noun.
Here, for example is a very simple code to handle GET ALL:</p>

<div class=indented><pre>
action get
#
# Check for the command being GET ALL.
#
  ifkey all               
    doall here, portable  # Sets up the &quot;do all&quot; loop
  fin
#
# The rest is ordinary handling of GET
#
  ifeq status, 2          # Do we know what to get?
    and
  ifhere arg2             # Is the the object in the same place as the player?
    and
  ifflag arg2, portable   # Is the object portable?
    apport arg2, inhand   # If so, relocate the object to player's possessions
    quip "You {arg1} the {arg2}  # Report the action.
  fin
fin
</pre></div>

<p>The DOALL directive in the above example sets up the do all loop of
command processing, with the effect of setting ARG2 to the first object
matching the specified criteria (being both co-located with the player and
flagged as portable), and sets the value of STATUS to 2. The effect of this is
that the rest of ACTION GET code results in that object being picked up
and the REPEAT code loop restarted (due to the use of QUIP instead of SAY
when reporting the action).</p>

<p>Because of the do loop being active, instead of prompting the player for the
next command, the kernel constructs that command by taking the same verb (GET
in our case) and combining it with the <i>next</i> matching object, if any.
That command is again processed in the normal way. This continues until such
time as there are no matching objects left, at which point the do all loop
is terminated and the player prompted for a command.</p>

<p>This is obviously a very simplistic implementation and various checks may
be necessary, such as e.g. checking that the player has a spare carrying
capacity for the next object to be picked up. Such checks cab be performed as
appropriate using the IFDOALL directive, which executes its associated block
of code if the do all loop is active. If needs be, the loop can be aborted by
the FLUSH directive.</p>

<p>TREASURE could be handled in a similar manner, assuming that in addition to
being flagged as being portable (via the game-defined flag PORTABLE in the
above example), it is also flagged as valuable by some other game defined
flag.</p>

<hr class=dotted id=except>
<h4>Using EXCEPT with collective nouns</h4>

<p>As a further enhancement of handling collective nouns, if EXCEPT is
declared as a vocabulary word, the parser accepts an extension of the simple
verb/noun command structure. Where a collective noun (e.g. ALL) is allowable
as a command noun, it can be followed by EXCEPT (or a synonym thereof) and a
list of entities to be exempt from the requested action. For example:</p>

<div class=indented>
<pre>
DROP ALL EXCEPT LAMP AND KEYS THEN READ POSTER
</pre>
</div>

<p>will be understood in a natural manner.</p>

<p>This expanded syntax has to, of course, cater for the possibility of
unregocgised words being given by the player in the
list of exceptions. To do so, this syntax enhancement brings into existence
the automatic variable ARG3. If a word in the exception list is not recogised,
the do-all loop is aborted and ARG3 is set to an apropriate error code, and
its associated word is the unrecognised word of the player's command. Here is
an example of this kind of error handling in Adv770:</p>

<div class=indented>
<pre>
   ifkey all
      call shadow.shutup
      ifeq arg3, badsyntax
         quip no.except, arg3
      fin
      ifeq arg3, ambigword
         quip tell.me.more, arg3
      fin
      ifeq arg3, badword
         flush
         quip nocomprende.object, arg3
      fin
      ifeq arg3, ambigtypo
         quip is.it.a.typo? arg3
      fin
      ....

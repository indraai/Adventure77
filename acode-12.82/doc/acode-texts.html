<h2 class=centered>A-code texts explained</h2>

<p>A-code texts are de facto objects with their own methods, making them
into a far more powerful and flexible game component than in any other
IF system. Yet they can be treated also as simple text strings &ndash;
the complexity of &quot;text morphing&quot; is there to be used, but it
does not force itself onto game writers.</p>

<p>This document explains A-code texts and their handling as of A-code

<h3>General notes on style</h3>

<ul>
<li>The use of upper/lower case in the examples is purely my programming
convention; except within text definitions, A-code is case
insensitive.</li>
<li>The use of dots to separate words in A-code entity names is also
conventional; any other convention could be used, e.g. using dashes or
underscores instead of dots, or (not recommended!) uppercasing the first
letter of each word.</li>
<li>The use of commas as A-code
statement parameter separators is purely optional, for increased
readability; A-code counts commas to be white spaces.</li>
<li>All examples use the up-to-date A-code notation (A-code 12), which differs in
some respects from that in the original version of the language by Dave Platt.</li>
</ul>

<hr id=ATB>
<h2>A-code text basics</h2>

<p>This part of the document deals with the basics of A-code text declaration and use.</p>

<hr id=ATD>
<h3>A-code text declarations</h3>

<p>As of version 12, in-line texts are also permitted (see the 
<a href="#ILT">in-line-text section</a>), but traditionally A-code defines
all its texts (other than place and objects descriptions) as separate
named entities. The basic A-code text declaration has the form</p>

<pre>
   TEXT &lt;text_name&gt;
      &lt;some_lines_of_text&gt;
</pre>

<p>Like all major A-code directives, the keyword TEXT must be at the very
beginning of a line. The text lines following it must all have at least
one leading blank. The declaration is terminated by a line with a
non-blank first character (i.e. another major directive or a comment),
or by end-of-file.</p>

<p>While generally line breaks are ignored in the text definition (see
the next section for more details), any texts declared using the TEXT 
directive are deemed to have a trailing end-of-line. A text fragment,
without the trailing EOL can be declared using the FRAGMENT variant of a
text declaration:<p>

<pre>
   FRAGMENT &lt;text_name&gt;
      &lt;some_lines_of_text&gt;
</pre>

<p>Here is a simple, purely artificial example:</p>

<pre>
   FRAGMENT LINE.START
      This line is sp
   TEXT LINE.END
      lit into two parts.
</pre>

<p>When displayed by the A-code primitive SAY</p>

<pre>
   say line.start
   say line.end
</pre>

<p>The result is a single line "This line is split into two parts."
followed by a line break.</p>

<p>Both TEXT and FRAGMENT directives can be used to declare
&quot;anonymous&quot; texts by omitting the text name. This practice goes back
to Dave Platt's original version and is now deprecated -- text switches can be
used instead. See <a href="#HAT">Appendix C</a> on handling anonymous
texts.<p>

<hr id=BTD>
<h3>Basics of text definitions</h3>

<p>A-code text definitions (the lines of text following the TEXT or
FRAGMENT declaration line), are processed as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Any leading or trailing spaces on an individual line are removed.
</li>
<li>
Simple line breaks (i.e. single end-of-line characters) are replaced
with a space, <i>after</i> the removal of trailing characters. (But see the
below discussion of <a href="#TSD">text switches</a> for an exception to this rule.) 
</li>
<li>
Successive line breaks are reduced to two line breaks. I.e. successive
blank lines are reduced to a single blank line
</li>
<li>
If after the removal of leading spaces, a line starts with a forward
slash, the slash is removed; the only purpose of this arrangement is to
be able to force a line to start with some leading spaces after all, or
to force multiple successive blank lines.
</li>
<li>
The reverse slash character <b></b> is used as a logical escape, to
enable the display of characters with a special meaning (see 
<a href="#SCH">Appendix B</a>).
The reverse slash itself can be escaped, of course, if it needs to be
displayed as an ordinary character.
</li>
<li>
All unescaped underscores are converted into spaces. This is another
mechanism for forcing leading spaces in a line of text.
</li>
</ul>

<hr id=ILT>
<h3>In-line texts</h3>

<p>In-line texts are accepted in all circumstances in which a reference
to a named text is acceptable. The basic syntax is extremely simple. If
a string beginning with a double quote is encountered where a text name 
would be appropriate, everything (line feeds included!) up to the next
double quote is accepted as the desired text.</p>

<p>The <b>acdc</b> translator in fact declares a standard A-code text,
assigns an automatically generated name to it, and replaces the whole
quoted string with that name. The upshot is that <i>all</i> text
features described in this document apply to in-line texts as well.</p>

<p>There is an additional syntax wrinkle to permit in-line texts to
be text fragments and to permit them to have their own internal
dynamics, as described in the <a href="#DIQ">dynamic implicit qualifiers
section</a> further in this document.</p>

<p>If an in-line text starts with the colon character <b>:</b> followed
by a character one of <b>i</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>r</b> or <b>f</b>, followed
by another colon, the character between the two colons gives the text a
special property.  If the character is <b>f</b> (&quot;:f:&quot;) then
the text is deemed to be a fragment, without a trailing line feed.  The
other three character declare the text dynamic method to be one of
<i>increment</i>, <i>cycle</i> or <i>random</i>, as explained in the
dynamic explicit qualifiers section below.</p>

<p>Since fragment texts may also have their own dynamic methods, this
additional syntax may be repeated as e.g. &quot;:f:c:&quot; or 
&quot;:r:f:&quot; etc.</p>

<p><b>WARNING</b> While in-line texts are convenient, they should be avoided
if one wishes to preserve upward compatibility of saved games. (See a <a
href="acode-upward.html">separate document on upward
compatibility in A-code</a>.)</p>

<hr id=CT>
<h3>Centered text</h3>

<p>A text definition line beginning with the plus character <b>+</b> is treated
as a line to be separately centered on the display. The plus sign is
stripped off, and the line is prefixed with a line break (unless it
happened to be preceded with one) and a line break is appended to it.
The result is displayed centered.</p>

<p>A-code also understands &quot;block centering&quot;. A centered block
is a set of successive text definition lines, each of which is prefixed
with the equals character <b>=</b>. The equals signs are stripped off,
and the whole block is displayed offset to the right in such a way that
its longest line appears centered on the display.</p>

<p>As with individual line centering, the block is prefixed by a line
break if one is required (i.e. there wasn't one already), and suffixed
with a line-break. Ends of line within the centered block are also
honoured, contrary to the more general A-code convention.</p>

<p>Here is an artificial example showing both kinds of centering:</p>

<pre>
   TEXT CENTERING.EXAMPLE
      This text shows
     +a centered line
     +and another centered line,
      as well as
     =a whole block
     =of lines, all of which
     =are centered as a single unit.
     Which is sometimes useful.
</pre>

<p>If displayed (e.g.) in a fixed font on an 78-character wide display by</p>

<pre>
   say centering.example
</pre>

<p>this would result in</p>

<pre>
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   |  This  text shows                                                            |
   |                               a centered line                                |
   |                          and another centered line,                          |
   |  as well as                                                                  |
   |                         a whole block                                        |
   |                         of lines, all of which                               |
   |                         are centered as a single unit.                       |
   |  Which is sometimes useful.                                                  |
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<hr id=TPP>
<h3>Text post-processing</h3>

<p>A-code texts are not displayed to the player immediately. They are
accumulated instead in an internal, dynamically sized buffer. The
contents of this buffer are post-processed and displayed by the kernel
when either a command prompt is issue to the player, or the game is 
about to exit. This permits some A-code directives to affect previously
output text.</p> 

<p>For example the <b>resay</b> directive, instead of appending
its text to the output buffer, first empties the buffer so that its text
completely replaces anything accumulated so far. On the other hand the
<b>append</b> directive preserves the accumulated text, but strips from
it any terminating blank lines, effectively appending its text to the
last output paragraph.</p>

<p>The A-code kernel processes the accumulated buffer before displaying its
contents, e.g. by normalising any successive blank lines to a single
blank line. (Multiple blank lines may be magicked up by using the
non-breaking space character &ndash; see the list of special characters
in <a href="#SCH">Appendix B</a>.</p> 

<hr id=ATM>
<h2>A-code text-morphing features</h2>
<p>This part of the document describes the &quot;text-morphing&quot;
features of A-code texts.</p>

<hr id=TSD>
<h3>Text switches defined</h3>

<p>A text switch is effectively an indexed array of strings
embedded in a text message. More
than one text switch can be embedded in a single text, and on the other
hand, a whole text may consist of a single text switch.</p>

<p>Formally, a text switch is a sequence of arbitrary text strings
separated by forward slashes, with the whole sequence being enclosed in
square brackets. E.g. </p>

<pre>
   [None/One/Two/Many]
</pre>

<p>is an example of a simple text switch of four elements.</p>

<p>The idea is that when the whole message is displayed to the player,
just one element from every given switch is selected for display,
according to some rule. The selection is made by using some
&quot;qualifier&quot; value as the index of each text switch array
encountered in the message.
Text switch elements are indexed from zero upwards, so that in the
above example the element <b>None</b> has the index value of zero, while
the element <b>Many</b> has the index value of three.</p>

<p>While ends of lines are treated in A-code text definitions as white
spaces (just like, for example in HTML), an end of line immediately
following a text switch separator character <b>/</b> is simply ignored,
which conveniently allows text switches to be spread across several
lines.  E.g.  the above shown switch could have been equivalently
written as</p>

<pre>
   [None/
    One/
    Two/
    Many]
</pre>

<p>because A-code ignores any line-leading (and line-trailing) spaces in text
definitions.</p>

<hr id=SEQ>
<h3>Simple text switches, explicitly qualified</h3>

<p>This text morphing feature was introduced by Dave Platt to handle
messages such as the report of dwarf attacks on the player.  Here's the
definition of a text called <b>knives.thrown</b> and containing two text
switches:</p>

<pre>
   TEXT KNIVES.THROWN
       [/One/Two/Three/Four/Five/Six/Seven/Many] nasty sharp kni[/fe is/ves are] thrown at you!
</pre>

<p>This is displayed by an A-code text-handling language primitive SAY:</p>

<pre>
   say &lt;text_name&gt;, [&lt;explicit_qualifier&gt;]
</pre>

<p>or in this specific case</p>

<pre>
   say knives.thrown, thrown
</pre>

<p>The second parameter (&quot;thrown&quot;) is in this case the name of a variable
holding the number
of knives thrown at the player, though from the point of view of the
language syntax, it could be a constant, or any A-code entity possessing
a value (e.g. an object or a location). In the absence of an implicit qualifier
(to be explained later),
this value is used to index any text switches embedded in the text
supplied as the 1st parameter, where switch elements are counted from
zero. So, if one knife is thrown, the displayed message will read:</p>

<pre>
   One nasty sharp knife is thrown at you!
</pre>

<p>But suppose more than one knife is thrown, say 5 of them. The first
switch is unproblematic -- its index values go from 0 to 8 -- but the
second switch only has elements 0, 1 and 2. This is handled by the
primary rule of text switches: <em>use the index value nearest to the
qualifier value</em>. So the message becomes:</p>

<pre>
   Five nasty sharp knives are thrown at you!
</pre>

<p>While in this example, the explicit qualifier was supplied as a
variable, any A-code entity which has a value associated with it (e.g.
an object, or a location, or a plain numeric constant) is also
acceptable as an explicit qualifier.</p>

<hr id=RTSE>
<h3>Repeated text switch elements</h3>

<p>In practice, text switch elements can be long, multi-line strings,
and sometimes it is necessary to have some of the elements repeated. For
example, if a player has a purse which can contain some coins, its
contents could be described by the following text:</p>

<pre>
   TEXT PURSE.CONTAINS
      There [are/is/are] 
      [no/one/two/three/several/several/several/several/several/several/many]
      coin[s//s] in the purse.
</pre>

<p>Such repetition is clearly wasteful, as well as tiresome, and the
maintenance of switches with repeat elements is unnecessarily complex,
because any changes to the repeated elements need to be applied to each
of them.</p>

<p>To get around this, A-code interprets a switch element consisting of
the single character <b>=</b> to mean a repeat of the immediately
preceding element. This in turn may have the same special format, in which
case its preceding element is considered. For obvious reasons, the first
(zero index) element of a switch may not be a repeat element.</p>

<p>Using this convention, the above PURSE.CONTAINS text could be defined
as</p>

<pre>
   TEXT PURSE.CONTAINS
      There [are/is/are] [no/one/two/three/several/=/=/=/=/=/many]
      coin[s//s] in the purse.
</pre>

<p>When qualified by an actual number of coins, this would specify the
number as <em>several</em> for 4 to 9 coins and as <em>many</em> for any
more than that.</p>

<hr id=WVH>
<h3>Word and value holders</h3>

<p>A-code texts can also contain word and value place-holders, which get
replaced dynamically at run-time by words or values specified by the
explicit qualifier. Place-holders of either kind can occur both outside
and inside text switches.</p>

<p>The dollar sign <b>$</b> is used as a value place-holder. If an
unescaped dollar sign is encountered in a text to be displayed, and if
the text is used with an explicit qualifier, the dollar is replaced with
the numerical value of the qualifier. For example, the
PURSE.CONTAINS text defined in the last section, could be re-defined as</p>

<pre>
   TEXT PURSE.CONTAINS
      There [are/is/are] [no/$] coin[s//s] in the purse.
</pre>

<p>In this case, the A-code statement</p>

<pre>
   say purse.contains, 13
</pre>

<p>would result in the display of</p>

<pre>
   There are 13 coins in the purse.
</pre>

<p>Of course, as before, any A-code value-bearing entity (variable,
location, object...) could be used as a qualifier, instead of a
constant value.<p>

<p>A word place-holder is signalled by an unescaped hash sign <b>#</b>, and
is conceptually similar, except that a word, rather than a value, indicated
by the explicit qualifier is inserted in place of the hash sign. Just
what can be used as an explicit qualifier in this case, is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>All declared vocabulary terms obviously have one (or more, if there
are synonyms) actual word associated with them.  At the author's
discretion, most objects and possibly some locations will also have an
associated vocabulary word or words.  In all these cases there
will be a &quot;primary&quot; word -- the first one declared
in the list of synonyms (if there are any synonyms).  It is this primary
word that gets inserted in place of a word place-holder.</p>

<p>All of this is easier to understand on some practical illustrations. Take for
example the object chair1 with the associated nouns &quot;chair&quot; 
and &quot;seat&quot;. Should there be a text declared as</p>

<pre>
   TEXT NO.KILL.THINGS
      The # is not something mortal, so cannot be killed!
</pre>

<p>and an object declared as</p>

<pre>
   OBJECT -CHAIR1, CHAIR, SEAT
</pre> 

<p>where the name CHAIR1 is explicitly excluded from the player's vocabulary,
then the statement</p>

<pre>
   say no.kill.things, chair1
</pre>

<p>would produce</p>

<pre>
   The chair is not something mortal, so cannot be killed!
</pre>

<p>What makes this much more useful than may appear at the first glance, is
the fact that A-code variables may store either values <b>or</b>
pointers (references, to you Algol fans!) to arbitrary A-code entities.
Hence if the game code executes somewhere the statement</p>

<pre>
   lda target, chair1         # Point variable TARGET at object CHAIR1
</pre>

<p>where &quot;target&quot; is a variable name, then a subsequent
statement</p>

<pre>
   say no.kill.things, target
</pre>

<p>will produce exactly the same display text as if the object
&quot;chair1&quot; or just the simple noun &quot;chair&quot; were used
as the explicit qualifier.</p>

<p>Word place-holders really come into their own because the
mandatory A-code variables ARG1 and ARG2 hold respectively the verb and
the noun of the player's last command. So assuming that the player said
&quot;KILL CHAIR&quot;, then</p>

<pre>
   say no.kill.things, arg2
</pre>

<p>would once again tell the player that chairs are not for killing.</p>

<p>However, there is a further subtlety here, when it comes to using player
command words pointed at by the ARG1 and ARG2 variables, because in this
case what is echoed as a part of the response is <em>not</em>
necessarily the primary word associated with the referenced object, but
the word actually used by the player (allowing for expansion of
abbreviations, typo correction and vocabulary folding -- see a separate
document on the full 3D structure of the 
<a href="acode-vocabulary.html">A-code vocabulary</a>). So if the
player typed &quot;KILL STO&quot; (note the abbreviation of STOOL to
STO, assumed to be unambiguous in this example), the displayed response
would be</p> 

<pre>
   The stool is not something mortal, so cannot be killed!
</pre>

<p>Word place-holders can also appear both within and without text
switches, but we'll cover that somewhat later on, under the heading of 
<a href="#QHI">switch and holder interplay</a>.

<hr id=SIQ>
<h3>Simple implicit qualifiers</h3>

<p> Not all texts need explicit qualification. For example, any texts
associated with objects or locations (i.e. various forms of object and
location descriptions) are deemed to be implicitly qualified by the
current state of the object or location -- i.e. by its current internal
value.</p>

<p>Take for example the object BATTERIES defined as</p>

<pre>
OBJECT BATTERIES, =BATTERY
   [/Fresh/Worn-out] batteries
  %[There is a pair of brand-new batteries in the goods tray./
   There are fresh batteries here./
   Some worn-out batteries have been discarded nearby.]
  &The two batteries are just the right size and shape for the lamp.
   Both are marked as "[BRAND-NEW/FRESH/WORN-OUT]" in
   chunky [blue/green/red] letters.
</pre>

<p>which has the usual triplet of the inventory, ordinary and detailed
descriptions. Each of these contains one or more text switches, which
will get automatically qualified by the state of the object. So for
instance, if the batteries are spent, the statement</p>

<pre>
   describe batteries
</pre>

<p>will display</p>

<pre>
   The two batteries are just the right size and shape for the lamp. Both are marked
   as "WORN-OUT" in chunky red letters.
</pre>

<p>Similarly the INVENTORY command and the general LOOK command will
display their appropriate descriptions qualifying the embedded text
switches by the object's state.</p>

<p>It is important to note that implicit qualifiers <em>always</em>
override any explicit qualifiers -- a point which will have a great
significance in the next section. For now it is sufficient to observe
that</p>

<pre>
   describe batteries, 0
</pre>

<p>would be completely pointless.</p>

<hr id=DIQ>
<h3>Dynamic implicit qualifiers</h3>

<p>As already noted elsewhere, A-code texts also carry an internal state
(or value),
initialised by default (like all A-code values) to zero. Note, however,
that to avoid overriding explicit qualifiers in simple text switches,
internal text states are only used as implicit qualifiers if a
&quot;method&quot; for their manipulation is given as a part of the text
definition. Formally, a full text definition looks like this:</p>

<pre>
   TEXT [&lt;method&gt;] &lt;text_name&gt;
      &lt;line_of_text&gt; 
      [....]
</pre>

<p>where &lt;method&gt; is one of <b>increment</b>, <b>cycle</b>,
<b>random</b> and <b>assigned</b>. All of these have different effects.</p>

<ul>
<li>
If the method specified is <b>increment</b>, then every time the text is
displayed, its internal state is incremented by one, until it reaches
the number of elements of the switch with most elements embedded in the text.
Here is an example from Adv770:

<pre>
TEXT increment ONCE.IS.ENOUGH

    [And thank goodness for that! /]I [/really /*really* /*REALLY* ]don't
    know why you decided to go and get lost in that dark forest. Let's
    say [once/twice/thrice/enough] is enough and not do it again, huh?
</pre>

This will automatically produce messages of increasing exasperation, as
the value of the text tick up after every use, finally sticking at the
value of 4.
</li>

<li>
<p>The <b>cycle</b> method also causes the internal text state to increment
by one, but the index value used by each individual switch within the
text is the state value modulo the switch size, and the state gets reset
to zero once it reaches the least common multiple of all switch sizes
within that text.</p>

<p>This is best demonstrated on a purely artificial example:

<pre>
   TEXT cycle DIGITS
      [1/2] [1/2/3] [1/2/3/4]
</pre>

If used repeatedly, the state of this text will increment by one from zero to
11 and then return to zero again and repeat the same cycle. In the
process it will produce successive displays &quot;1 1 1&quot;, &quot;2 2 2&quot;, &quot;1 3 3&quot;,
&quot;2 1 4&quot;, &quot;1 2 1&quot;, &quot;2 3 2&quot;, &quot;1 1 3&quot;, &quot;2 2 4&quot;, &quot;1 3 1&quot;, &quot;2 1 2&quot;, &quot;1 2 3&quot;,
&quot;2 3 4&quot;, &quot;1 1 1&quot; etc...</p>

<p>As you can see above, each of the switches cycles independently of
the rest, yet only one text state value is driving the whole process.
This is very useful in assembling automatically at run-time a wide
variety of responses.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <b>random</b> method does what one would expect. After the text is
displayed using its current state value, this value is reset at random
to a value within the index range of the largest embedded text switch.
The new value chosen is guaranteed to be different from the
current one, so for switches with two components, this method acts
exactly as the cycle one.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <b>assigned</b> method is really a pseudo-method in that it does not
actually do anything, other than enabling the text value as an implicit
qualifier. Without it, the internal text state is ignored by switch
processing, and an explicit qualifier has to be supplied instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be noted that none of the above described methods, nor the
&quot;null&quot; non-method (i.e. when no method is specified) preclude
the state value to be assigned into a text or numerically manipulated and
examined like any ordinary variable. So for example, taking the above
defined DIGITS text, the statements</p>

<pre>
   say digits        # Internal state starts from 0!
   add digits, 10    # It got incremented to 1, so will now be 11
   say digits        # It's now 11 so will be reset back to zero
   say digits
</pre>

<p>would result in &quot;1 1 1&quot, &quot;2 3 4&quot, &quot;1 1
1&quot</p>

<p>In-line texts can also have dynamic implicit qualifiers. If such
a text starts with the colon character ':', followed by a letter,
followed by another colon, these three characters are stripped off and
a dynamic method is associated with the in-line text in question on the
basis of the letter between the two colons: <b>i</b> for
<i>increment</i>, <b>c</b> for <i>cycle</i>, <b>r</b> for <i>random</i>.
Note that the absence of the <i>assigned</i> pseudo-method, on the
grounds that there is no way for an in-line text to be referred to by
the rest of the A-code source.</p>

<h3>Switch and holder interplay</h3>

<p>Now that we have been through the details of implicit qualifiers, the
interplay between text switches and place-holders can be stated very
simply as two rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>
Only explicit qualifiers are used when substituting for place-holders of
either kind.
</li>
<li>
For processing text switches, implicit qualifiers always override
explicit qualifiers.
</li>
</ol>

<p>This enables responses such as exemplified by the Adv770 text
ITS.JUST.A:

<pre>
TEXT cycle ITS.JUST.A
    It's just a #. [Nothing very remarkable about it/Not remarkable in
    any way/Nothing special to it/The apt description is "unremarkable"].
</pre>

The typical use for this text is

<pre>
   say its.just.a, arg2
</pre>

which will replace the word place-holder in the text with the noun from
the player's last command, while cycling in its successive uses through
its embedded text switch.</p>

<p>It may at first appear strange that implicit qualifiers are
ignored in place-holder substitution, while explicit qualifiers are
overridden by implicit ones for switch processing. However, this
arrangement does exactly what is often wanted, because it makes it much
more sensible to have place-holders within text switches. Again, an
example from Adv770 is probably a good illustration:

<pre>
TEXT cycle NOCOMPRENDE.VERB
    [My ignorance shames me, but I do not know what action might be
    signified by "#"./Alas, my vocabulary is too limited to encompass "#".
    Try some other verb?/Very remiss of me to be sure, but I've never
    learned to "#"./To my shame, I have no idea what you mean by
    "#"./"#"? Sorry, I don't what it means./I am afraid "#" is not a
    verb I've ever learned./Ahem... "#" is not in my dictionary.
    Would you care to re-phrase?/Regrettably, that is not something I
    know how to do.]
</pre>

If the game fails to make sense of the player's verb, all it has to do
now is

<pre>
   say nocomprende.verb, arg1
</pre>

thereby producing a wide variety of responses.</p>

<p>As an aside, in practice I find that the <b>cycle</b> method is much
more useful for this purpose than the <b>random</b> one. Contrary to our
intuitive expectation, randomness tends to be non-uniform (i.e.
&quot;clumpy&quot;) and hence
requires a large number of options, if obvious repetitions are
to be avoided.</p>

<h3>Text tying</h3>

<p>As already noted, A-code variables can be in fact pointers to other
A-code entities. The same is true for internal values of A-code texts. A
text can be &quot;tied&quot; to another value-bearing entity, thereby
removing the need for the game code to explicitly
ensure the text value stays in sync with the state of that other entity.</p>

<p>In effect, tying texts to other entities is also a text "method" in
that it activates the text's implicit qualifier (which in this case
happens to be the value of the entity to which the text is tied).
Because this additional text method is not purely internal to the text,
there may be reasons for the tying to be performed dynamically within
the game code. Hence tying is performed by means of an executable
language statement, rather than in text declaration.</p>

<p>Once again, an example may be of help.
Adv770 has a quartz seal, which can have one of two states. If
the player tries to examine the seal when it is not in his inventory, the
game tells him the seal is too small and needs to be picked up. The
actual wording of this admonition depends on the state of the seal,
hence the game initialisation code contains the statement

<pre>
   tie pick.up.seal, seal
</pre>

This effectively ties the value of the text PICK.UP.SEAL to the value of the
object SEAL. From now on, if the state of the object changes, the
message displayed by

<pre>
   say pick.up.seal
</pre>

will automatically change to match, because PICK.UP.SEAL contains a
two-component text switch.</p>

<p>Yes, in this particular case one could use SEAL as an explicit
qualifier:

<pre>
   say pick.up.seal, seal
</pre>

The seal example merely illustrates the technique. It is too
simple to show the justification of that technique. The actual motivation
for introducing text tying in A-code was provided by my efforts to
resolve a highly complex problem of constructing a location description
which depended on several independent factors. It is far too complex to
be presented as an illustrative example.</p>

<hr id=NT>
<h3>Text nesting</h3>

<p>Sometimes a number of separate messages (e.g. location descriptions)
consist of a part which is common to them all, and another part which is
specific to a given message (or group of messages). This can present
maintenance problems (e.g. fixing a typo in <i>all</i> identical parts) and
is also wasteful. A-code offers an alternative approach. The common
message part can be defined as a separate text fragment (i.e. a text
without a trailing end-of-line character), which can be
&quot;nested&quot; within individual messages.</p>

<p>An A-code message text may include the symbolic name of another text
enclosed in unescaped braces (i.e. curly brackets): {<text_name>}. When
the message is displayed, this construct gets replaced with the text
indicated by the text name within the braces. The nesting mechanism is
recursive, so the nested text may have further texts nested within it.</p>

<p>Here's an example from
Adv770, showing the declarations of the first six of the Adv550's ice
tunnels. It uses double-level nesting.

<pre>
FRAGMENT INTRICATE.TUNNELS
   You are in an intricate network of ice tunnels.
#
FRAGMENT ICE.DEAD.END
   {INTRICATE.TUNNELS} The only exit is
#
FRAGMENT ICE.TUNNELS
   {INTRICATE.TUNNELS} Exits lead
#
PLACE ICE.CAVE.1
   {ICE.TUNNELS} north and west.
#
PLACE ICE.CAVE.1A
   {ICE.DEAD.END} south.
#
PLACE ICE.CAVE.2
   {ICE.TUNNELS} north, east and west.
#
PLACE ICE.CAVE.2A
   {ICE.TUNNELS} north and south.
#
PLACE ICE.CAVE.3
   {ICE.TUNNELS} north and east.
#
PLACE ICE.CAVE.3A
   {ICE.DEAD.END} south.
</pre>

<p>Nested texts may have their own implicit qualifiers, of course. If
the top level text is used with an explicit qualifier, this is passed on
as an explicit qualifier to all nested texts, to any depth.</p>

<p>As a special case, A-code also permits nesting of the ARG1 and ARG2
variables, which are treated as the words actually typed by the player
(possibly expanded from an abbreviated state, and typo-corrected). This
is used, for example, as follows:

<pre>
   TEXT YOU.DO.IT
      You {ARG1} the {ARG2}.
</pre>

If the player typed (e.g.) "G LAMP", and succeeded in picking up the lamp, 

<pre>
   say you.do.it
</pre>

would display "You get the lamp."</p>

definitions, and have to be escaped with a reverse slash if they are to
be displayed &quot;raw&quot;.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b></b> (reverse slash)</dt>
<dd>A universal logical escape character. Any immediately following
character other, including the reverse slash itself, but excluding

<h3>Appendix C: Handling anonymous texts (deprecated!)</h3>

<p>Anonymous texts can be only handled through pointers. Count text
declarations backwards from the anonymous text in question, until you
come to a named text. The resulting count is the anonymous text's offset
from that named text. Point a variable at that named text and then
add the offset to the variable. The variable now points at your
anonymous text and all A-code primitives which handle automatic
indirection, will accept the variable as a reference to the anonymous
text.</p>

<p>Here's an example in the shape of a complete A-code test program:</p>

<pre>
   style A-code 12
   TEXT FIRST.TEXT
      First text
   TEXT
      Second text
   TEXT
      Third text
   init
      local ptr
      lda ptr, first.text
      add ptr,2
      say ptr
      stop
   repeat
</pre>

It will print "Third text" and then stop. (NB: The repeat section is
null, but the translator will complain if it is absent.)</p>

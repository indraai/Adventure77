<p>
  Though A-code is not by any stretch of imagination (and despite its virtues)
  a popular IF language, you never know &ndash; the built-in browser mode,
  plus the ability to create pure HTML/Javascript versions might attract a
  brave soul or two. Hence this page.

  Not included are a few things, which as a putative user you are expected to
  provide on your own:
  <ul>
    <li>A text editor of your choice</li>
    <li>An ANSI C compiler</li>
    <li>And if you wish to try your hand in creating new games:
      a dash of creative imagination.</li>

<h3 class=centered>A-code sources</h3>
  Complete A-code system sources and documentation are supplied as a single
  tarball (<a href='https://mipmip.org/acode/acode-12.82.tgz'
  >mipmip.org/acode/acode-12.82.tgz</a>). Please see <a
  href='acode-tarball.html'>the tarball description document</a> for
  information on its contents.

<h3 class=centered>Building games from source</h3>

<p>
  Firstly, let's deal with building runnable games from A-code source files
  and the ways of running such games, once built.
</p>

<p id=types><b><a href="acode-builds.html">A-code build types explained</a></b><br>
  Acode games can be built in five distinct ways: console, combined
  browser/console, single-turn (for running in a cloud in a CGI, PHP or
  similar wrapper), HTML/JavaScript and library test. This document explains
  what all these build types are are and what they are for.
</p>

<p id=advbld><b><a href="advbld.html">Using the <i>advbld</i> script to build A-code
  games</a></b><br> Since this file is a part of my A-code framework bundle,
  you clearly have the <i>advbld</i> script installed. This document explains
  how to use the script to build A-code games in various modes, so you don't
  have to bother with the &quot;how&quot; of it.
</p>

<p id=running><b><a href="acode-comline.html">Running A-code games</a></b><br>
  The A-code kernel understands a number of command line options, though some
  of these need active support from the A-code source. E.g. adv550 does not
  understand the name of a game save-file to restore being supplied on the
  command line, and may land the player in limbo, with no source of light.
</p>

<hr>

<p id=acdc>
  If you cannot or do not wish to use the <i>advbld</i> script for building
  games, here are a couple of document explaining how to do it in a more
  &quot;manual&quot; manner.
</p>

<p><b><a href="acode-a-build.html">Translating A-code source into
  compilable C code</a></b><br>To build an A-code game from its A-code sources
  (files suffixed with .acd), you first have to use the <b><i>acdc</i></b>
  translator to create derived C sources. This document explains how.
</p>

<p id=cbuild><b><a href="acode-c-build.html">Creating an executable from
  derived C sources</a></b><br>Once you have created (or downloaded) derived C
  sources of an A-code game, you are ready to create various modes of
  executables. This document explains how. (See <a href="acode-builds.html">a
  separate document</a> for an explanation of build modes.)
</p>

<hr id=language>

<h3 class=centered>The A-code language</h3>

<p id=ref><b><a href="acode-language.html">A-code 12 guide</a></b>
  Explains the concepts of the language and provides a reference guide to its
  components.
</p>

<p id=parser><b><a href="acode-parser.html">A-code parser</a></b><br>
  This document describes A-code parser, which has some unusual features.
</p>

<p id=texts><b><a href="acode-texts.html">A-code texts</a></b><br>
  This document explains the details of A-code texts in all their unique
  glory. A minimal understanding of the A-code language is helpful but not
  essential.
</p>

<p id=vocab><b><a href="acode-vocabulary.html">A-code vocabulary</a></b><br> This
  document explains the unique aspects of A-code vocabulary handling.
</p>

<hr id=deeper>

<h3 class=centered>Diving deeper...</h3>

<p>
  The next group of documents discusses some aspects of the language in a
  greater depth.
</p>

<p id=undo><b><a href="acode-undo.html">The UNDO and REDO directives</a></b><br>
  The A-code UNDO and REDO directives explained.
</p>

<p id=library><b><a href="acode-advturn.html">The library mode interface</a></b><br>
  In the ADVLIB mode, the A-code kernel presents itself as a
  function called <b>advturn</b>. This document describes its
  functionality and calling sequence.
</p>

<p id=context><b><a href="acode-context.html">The CONTEXT mechanism</a></b><br> If an
  A-code game is to run in a cloud, which is very useful for
  beta-testing, it must not use the the QUERY directive. This
  document explains how the CONTEXT variable can be used to avoid
  use of QUERY. (The no-QUERY restriction may be removed in a future
  version of A-code, in which case this page will become obsolete.)
</p>

<p id=compat><b><a href="acode-upward.html">Upward compatibility of saved
  games</a></b><br>A-code is unusual in that with a little care a
  game author can ensure that saved games are upward compatible and
  can be loaded by later game versions. This document explains how.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
  Finally, some history... <b><a href="acode-history.html">A-code
  history</a></b>

<h2 class=centered>The CONTEXT mechanism<br>or how to avoid use of QUERY</h2>

<p>The way A-code is currently implemented, has one substantial disadvantage. 
The two input directives (INPUT and QUERY) expect execution to proceed from
the the point where they have been called, which is fine if the game
executable takes care of its own main loop. However, in the single turn (CGI)
and library modes, this is not the case. Input is obtained by other
controlling software (e.g. by a PHP script, in the single turn mode) and there
is no mechanism to return the game to the point at which an input directive
is used. The problem is aggravated by the fact that it may make perfect sense
to have multiple calls for input in a single pass through the main loop (e.g.
get general command, if this command is SAVE without a name to save the game
under, get the name; if there is already such a saved game, query whether it
should be overwritten).</p>

<p>In Platt's original A-code implementation as a virtual machine this would
not have been a problem. One simply saved the state of the VM before returning
control to the external software. Once the game code is re-invoked and
supplied with the next command, the VM state is restored and execution
proceeds as normal. Things are nowhere near as simple when a game is simply an
executable (or a library) built from C sources.</p>

<p>There are possible solutions, of course. The game could be split into two
processes: one in charge of player communication and the other running the
game's world. Indeed, that's how the browser mode build works, but this
arrangement is not suitable for running in a third-party cloud.<p> 

<p>The CONTEXT mechanism was my solution to this problem when implementing
the original CGI-based implementation of Adv770 to be used by game's
beta-testers. The idea is a simple one. The game can acquire query responses
as a part of the main loop &ndash; it just needs to know that a question has
been asked and specifically <i>what</i> question has been asked. Then having
acquired player's input it can deal with it appropriately.</p>

<p>At first glance, no kernel involvement is required for this to work, but
there are reasons why it does have to be aware of this mechanism. Otherwise
anomalies would arise in in e.g. orphan command word handling and the game
persistence mechanism. Thus variable named CONTEXT is deemed to be special
by the kernel. If it is set to zero, the next expected input is just a 
general game command. If set to non-zero, however, an answer to a particular
query is expected by the game.</p>

<p>Here is a very simple example. First a trivial A-code program using
QUERY:<p>

<div class=indented><pre>
style 12
verb quit
init
repeat
  input               # No initialisation
  query "Really?_"    # The undesrore is a foced space
    ifkey quit
      say "Bye..."
      stop
    else
      say "OK."
    fin
  else
    say "If not, not."
  fin
  say "_"             # Add a blank line
</pre></div>

<p>And here is one possible equivalent using the CONTEXT variable instead of
the QUERY directive:</p>

<div class=indented><pre>
style 12
var context
verb quit
verb yes              # Any other query answer is deemed to be no
init                  # CONTEXT automatically initialised to zero
repeat
  ifeq context, 0     # A general command is required
    proceed
  fin
  save command        # Preserve player's original command
  input               # Get query response
  ifkey yes
    restore command   # Restore the original command
    ifkey quit        # And act on it if appropriate
      say "Bye..."
      stop
    fin
    say "OK."
  else
    say "If not, not."
  fin
  set context, 0      # Insure next loop is just a general command one
  quip "_"            # Add a blank line
repeat
  input
  set context, 1      # Signal query processing is needed
  quip "f:Really?_"
</pre></div>
